Spam-Juggler - free, quick and feature rich disposable email service
[ http://hot.as/spam-juggler/ ]

Spam-Juggler is a free, quick and feature rich disposable email service,
that can help you protect your real email address. If you give your email
address to the public, - for sure - you are bound to receive spam messages,
and you will not know where they came from. Would not it be useful to give
a different email address to everyone, like forums or websites (which
threaten you with account registering processes), while getting all your
emails as before? Would not it be the easiest an alternative email address
will be given to spammers, and have it work as a spam blocker by shutting off
automatically after a specific time period or a specific amount of received
emails over this alternative email address? That is exactly what Spam-Juggler
offers! There is no need to download and install any software on your
computer - you will have access to this service from all over the world through
your browser, and you do not need to register an account to use this service.
This is what makes Spam-Juggler one of the best and most convenient and effective
anti-spam tools available.

Spam-Juggler allows you to create so called "forwarding" or "alias" email
addresses. Every email which is sent to such an alias email address will
be forwarded to a given "real" email address without any limitations or
modifications. That means, you receive emails as before, even with
attachments (if any). Spam-Juggler simply stops forwarding for an alias
email address after a specific time period or a specific amount of received
emails has been reached. All incoming emails to such an alias email address
will be removed immediately. The hack is: a normal email system sends a
notification message back to sender on any errors, such as "user not found /
does not exist"... Spam-Juggler does not, so spammers believe their trashy
mails arrive their destinations. ;)
